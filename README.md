# Jira Time Converter

The Jira Time Converter is a Google Chrome extension designed to convert time formats specified with a dot, such as 8.4h, into the hour-minute format, like 8h 24m.
<br><br>
This extension was developed in response to a bug in the **Jira WorklogPro plugin** at my workplace. This issue prevented users from entering logs in the dot hour format, leading to the need for manual conversion to the hour-minute format. The bug has caused inconvenience, and I developed this extension to serve as a temporary solution until the bug is fixed.
